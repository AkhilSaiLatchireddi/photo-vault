i want to create a app for myself to access via mobile and web desktop, baseically i  came across a problem that google only stores data free upto 17 gb , escpecially photots and videos, so i crossed my quota, so i had no place to store those, now i want to create an app that does the similar to google photots, and i will store all my data in s3 bucket because i have some aws credits, i want to host this app as well using pretty much modern architecture in aws, lets not do all at once, lets first create a basic app and create a fetures files for creating all sub tasks for futurte to improve this app, one more main thing is similar to google photots it should also give memeories etc... as fetures.
