i want to create a app for myself to access via mobile and web desktop, baseically i came across a problem that google only stores data free upto 17 gb , escpecially photots and videos, so i crossed my quota, so i had no place to store those, now i want to create an app that does the similar to google photots, and i will store all my data in s3 bucket because i have some aws credits, i want to host this app as well using pretty much modern architecture in aws, lets not do all at once, lets first create a basic app and create a fetures files for creating all sub tasks for futurte to improve this app, one more main thing is similar to google photots it should also give memeories etc... as fetures.



I'll help you create a modern photo storage app similar to Google Photos that uses AWS S3 for storage. Let's start by creating a basic app structure and then create a comprehensive features roadmap.

First, let me check the current workspace and then set up a new project for your photo storage app.

Read temp2

Read idea1.md

Perfect! I'll create a modern photo storage app for you. Let me start by setting up a comprehensive project structure with a modern tech stack and then create detailed feature files for future development.

Using "Create New Workspace"

Let me create the project structure directly in your current workspace:

Created README.md

Now let me create the basic project structure and feature files:

Created package.json

Created features

Created README.md

Now let me create the core feature specifications starting with the high-priority Phase 1 features:

Created 01-authentication.md

Created 02-file-upload.md

Created 12-memories.md

Now let me create the basic project structure with the frontend and backend:

Created frontend

Created backend

Created package.json

Created package.json

Created next.config.js

Created tailwind.config.ts

Created .env.example

Created ROADMAP.md

Now let me create a few more essential files to complete the basic setup:

Created .gitignore

Created index.ts

Created tsconfig.json

Created layout.tsx

Created page.tsx

Created globals.css

Now let me create a setup script to help you get started quickly:

Sorry, your request failed. Please try again. Request id: d84d0978-8637-4394-bab3-5cf7e4ae0ed6

Reason: Please check your firewall rules and network connection then try again. Error Code: net::ERR_NETWORK_IO_SUSPENDED.




Finally, let me create a comprehensive summary document and provide you with the installation instructions:

Created SETUP.md

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of the implementation, such as setting up AWS services or implementing the first features?




Now let me create the middleware and validators:

Created auth.middleware.ts

Created auth.validator.ts

Now let me create the file upload service:

Created file.service.ts

Now let me create a simple frontend authentication setup:

Created AuthContext.tsx

Created LoginForm.tsx

Finally, let me create a comprehensive start guide and update the main entry files:

index.ts+3-3

ok intstead of using some remote db for now use some light weight db like sqllite and also create a login and register mechanism, using unique email, username and password and if automatic gamil authertication is free please implement that also if not add it for future backlog, and for storing use that unique usename as a key to store photots and also store phhotos based on yeasr month date etc so that we can ge tthat back and show that in the timestamps etc.. also sotre the metadata like when is the photot uploaded etc.., add all these thing to the fetures and implement it now
