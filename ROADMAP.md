# PhotoVault Development Roadmap

## 🚀 Current Status: Project Setup Complete

You now have a solid foundation for your PhotoVault application! Here's what we've created:

### ✅ Completed
- Project structure with frontend (Next.js) and backend (Node.js/Express)
- Comprehensive feature roadmap with 32+ detailed features
- Core infrastructure planning for AWS services
- Package configurations with modern dependencies
- Environment setup guidelines

### 📋 Immediate Next Steps (Week 1-2)

#### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm run install:all

# Set up environment files
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in your AWS credentials and database details
```

#### 2. AWS Infrastructure Setup
- Create S3 bucket for photo storage
- Set up AWS Cognito User Pool
- Configure IAM roles and policies
- Set up RDS PostgreSQL database

#### 3. Basic Authentication (Priority: HIGH)
- Implement Cognito integration
- Create login/register forms
- Set up protected routes
- Test authentication flow

#### 4. File Upload System (Priority: HIGH)
- S3 integration for photo storage
- Basic upload interface
- Thumbnail generation with Lambda
- File metadata extraction

### 🎯 Phase 1 Goals (Month 1)
- [ ] Working authentication system
- [ ] Photo upload to S3
- [ ] Basic photo gallery
- [ ] Responsive web interface
- [ ] Database schema implementation

### 🎯 Phase 2 Goals (Month 2)
- [ ] Photo viewer with zoom/navigation
- [ ] Basic search functionality
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Photo organization features

### 🎯 Phase 3 Goals (Month 3+)
- [ ] Memories feature implementation
- [ ] AI-powered tagging
- [ ] Face recognition
- [ ] Advanced search and filters

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Frontend (Next.js 14)
- Modern React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- AWS Amplify for auth integration
- React Query for data fetching
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- RESTful API with TypeScript
- Prisma ORM for database operations
- AWS SDK for S3 and Cognito
- JWT-based authentication
- Background job processing

### AWS Services
- **S3**: Photo/video storage with lifecycle policies
- **Cognito**: User authentication and management
- **RDS**: PostgreSQL for metadata and user data
- **Lambda**: Image processing and thumbnail generation
- **CloudFront**: CDN for fast image delivery
- **ECS/Fargate**: Container hosting (future)

## 🛠️ Development Tips

### Getting Started
1. Start with the [Authentication feature](./features/01-authentication.md)
2. Then implement [File Upload](./features/02-file-upload.md)
3. Follow the detailed sub-tasks in each feature file
4. Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next

### Best Practices
- Follow the AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Use TypeScript for better code quality
- Implement proper caching strategies

### Cost Optimization
- Use S3 Intelligent Tiering for storage cost optimization
- Implement CloudFront caching for reduced bandwidth costs
- Monitor AWS costs regularly
- Use AWS Free Tier benefits where possible

## 📱 Mobile Strategy
- Start with responsive web design
- Progressive Web App (PWA) for mobile experience
- Consider React Native app in Phase 4
- Implement mobile-specific features like camera integration

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- Use AWS IAM best practices
- Implement proper CORS configuration
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- Regular security audits and updates
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics
- Set up CloudWatch for monitoring
- Implement error tracking (Sentry)
- Add user analytics for feature usage
- Monitor performance metrics
- Set up alerts for critical issues

## 🤝 Contributing to Your Project
- Each feature has detailed specifications
- Sub-tasks are broken down with effort estimates
- Priority levels help you focus on what's important
- Test requirements ensure quality implementation

Start with Phase 1 features and gradually build up your PhotoVault! The modular approach allows you to implement features incrementally while maintaining a working application at each stage.
